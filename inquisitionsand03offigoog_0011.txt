-Tun coutents of this, the Fifth Volume of Feudal Aius, require
only a few explanatory notes Returns for eight counties (Stafford
-Worcesterl are included in the volume, but appear deficient or
scanty in many respecta, sallon, sonex, and Wiltshlre alone being
adequately represented.

¹ The date of the inquisition for the rape of Pevensey, co. Sussex

(pp. 130-132)‚ is conjectural. To a later inquisition, printed on
pp. 144, 145, the date nn. 1324-1325 has been assigned. This
latter date has been suggested by a comparison with similer inquisi-
tions lor Wiltahire (sec pp. 213-219), held by the collector of the
scutage for the late Scotch wars, in the 17th year of the reign

of Edward ll. Allusiou is made in both cases to tenants of the ⁴

28th. 31st and 34th years of the late king's reign, and from this
and other indications it may be inserted that the returns for both

countics arc contemporaneous.

A return of parishes in four Sussex deoneries containing less
than ten inhabitants is printed 011 pp. llil, 165. The names of
the inhabitants of each parish are recorded. 'Phe date of this
interesting record is ab. 1428.

The roll oi' Nuntius Vitiorum (nu. 1316) for Warwick also

- contains a list ol leicester wunships‚ which was not included in

the returns for that county printed in Feudul Aius, Vol. IV„ and

is therefore printed in the present volume.
